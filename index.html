          <p>
            When head of NASA security Carol Danvers was exposed to a powerful alien device,
             she transformed into the mighty cosmic powered hero, Captain Marvel!
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>Flight in space</h2>
          <p>
            After an alien device mutated her DNA, Danvers transformed from a merely 
            brilliant pilot into one of the most powerful Super Heroes in the universe. 
            Now soaring among the stars, Carol Danvers is known as Captain Marvel!
            <br>
            Captain Marvel has the power of flight, which she uses in tandem 
            with her ability to breathe in the vacuum of space to journey at 
            super speed throughout the cosmos.
            <br>
          </p>

          <h2>Binary Powers</h2>
          <p>Carol’s Binary powers, though largely dormant, 
              can bestow her with the might of a white hole, 
              allowing her to generate and control any form of radiation or gravity

            A deadly assassin is closing in on Natasha Romanoff. 
            Now Natasha must reunite with an unlikely group of spies from 
            her past in order to survive and stop a lethal force

            Combining all manner of weapons with her background in gymnastics, 
            acrobatics, and ballet, she always accomplishes her mission.
            <br><br>
          <h2>Strength and Agility</h2>  
            Exhibiting no superhuman abilities, the Black Widow boasts

          <p>Thanos directed Ronan’s mission to retrieve the powerful Orb and

              that followed and he lost the Infinity Stone housed in the Orb.</p>
           <h2>Death on Vormir</h2>  
           <p>On Vormir, Thanos, in tears, killed his daughter and was then gifted with the Soul
